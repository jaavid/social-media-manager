# Social Stats — Open-Source Social Media Management & Marketing Platform

> An open-source, self-hostable alternative to Hootsuite, Buffer & Sprout Social.

**Social Stats** is an open-source **social media management** and marketing platform for
agencies and teams. One product unifies a **social media scheduler** and **content calendar**,
cross-platform **analytics dashboards**, a unified conversation inbox, a click-to-WhatsApp
**bot builder**, and an **AI social media assistant** — across **Facebook**, **Instagram**,
**YouTube**, **LinkedIn**, and **Google Business**, with WhatsApp Business as a first-class
messaging module and first-class **Telegram** / **Bale** bot-channel publishing. It's built
on **Django + React** and is fully self-hostable.

## Demo

Spin up a fully-seeded local instance in two commands:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py demo_setup    # seeds 3 accounts + 90 days of sample analytics
```

`demo_setup` is idempotent and creates three accounts (password `demo` for all),
then chains into the sample-data seeder so the dashboards aren't empty. Sign in at
`/login`, which surfaces one-click sign-in buttons for each:

| Account | Email | Password | Lands on |
|---|---|---|---|
| Superadmin | `admin@demo.local` | `demo` | `/admin` |
| Agency member | `agency@demo.local` | `demo` | `/dashboard` + `/agency/*` |
| End user | `enduser@demo.local` | `demo` | `/u` |

> These are local-only demo credentials — never deploy them to a real environment.

> click-through and stars. (See "Add a screenshot" in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.)

## Features

Social Stats is a full product, not a single dashboard. It ships a public
**marketing website**, an **admin shell**, **multi-client dashboards**, and the
modules below — all in one codebase.

### 📊 Analytics & reporting
- Cross-platform analytics dashboards (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, Google Business)
- KPI overview — impressions, reach, clicks, video views, followers — per client and aggregated
- Per-platform performance tables, distribution & comparison charts, date-range filters
- Reports (exportable) + **AI-narrated** monthly summaries
- Sync-activity logs and performance alerts

### ✍️ Content & publishing
- **Composer** — write once, format per platform, schedule
- Publish to Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, Google Business, **Telegram**, and **Bale**
- Telegram/Bale bot credentials are verified live and encrypted at rest; each post can optionally override its default channel/chat destination
- **Content calendar** + **Queue manager** for scheduled posting
- **Media Library** for reusable assets
- **Video Studio** — trim/resize, captions, thumbnails, direct YouTube upload
- Agency **approval flows** before client posts go live

### 💬 Engage
- **Unified inbox** — DMs, comments, and Google reviews in one queue, AI reply suggestions
- **Reviews** management
- **Automations** — IF-this-THEN-that rules (e.g. keyword → template reply)

### 🤖 AI Studio (powered by Anthropic Claude)
- Cmd/Ctrl+J **AI assistant** with tool use + chat history
- Smart Composer, Caption Writer, Post Ideas, Hashtag Research
- **Brand Voice** training, **AI Insights** (trends/anomalies/forecasts), AI Audit & usage tracking

### 📱 WhatsApp & CTWA bots
- WhatsApp dashboard, inbox, contacts, lists, **templates**, **campaigns**
- **Click-to-WhatsApp bot builder** — visual flow editor with conditional branches & AI nodes
- Bot conversations, human-handoff queue, bot analytics, template gallery

### 👥 CRM, marketplace & agencies
- **Leads/CRM** — captured leads with conversation history
- **Agency marketplace** — two-sided directory; profiles, reviews, invites, manage-requests, disputes
- Multi-client agency workspaces with **granular per-client permissions**

### 🛠️ Admin & platform
- **Admin shell** (`/admin`) — manage all users, clients, staff access, audit log, approval & trust queues
- **Public marketing site** — home, features, solutions, customers, blog, help center, status, changelog, legal pages
- **Realtime** updates (WebSockets / Django Channels), **PWA**/offline support
- Security: JWT + Argon2, MFA/TOTP, session management, django-axes, Fernet-encrypted tokens, GDPR/DPDP tooling
- **Light & dark theme** toggle, fully responsive (mobile PWA layout)

### Account types

| Account | What they see |
|---|---|
| `superadmin` / `staff` | Full admin shell at `/admin` |
| Agency member (`role=client`, `account_type=agency_member`) | Shared dashboard at `/dashboard` + agency-only management at `/agency/*` |
| End user (`role=client`, `account_type=end_user`) | End-user shell at `/u` + a single workspace they own |

---

## Who is it for?

- **Social media agencies** managing many client brands from one place, with per-client workspaces, granular permissions, and approval flows.
- **In-house marketing teams** running several brand/social accounts who want scheduling, analytics, and a shared inbox without per-seat SaaS fees.
- **Solo creators & small businesses** who want a free, self-hosted tool to plan posts, track growth, and reply to messages across platforms.
- **Developers** who want a customizable, MIT-licensed Django + React base they can self-host and extend.

## How it works

1. **Connect accounts** — link Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, Google Business, and WhatsApp via OAuth/manual setup; connect Telegram and Bale with a bot token plus channel/chat destination. Tokens are encrypted at rest, per workspace. See [docs/CONNECT_ACCOUNTS.md](docs/CONNECT_ACCOUNTS.md).
2. **Plan & publish** — draft once in the composer, format per platform, schedule on the content calendar; agency posts can route through client approval. Telegram/Bale posts can use the connected default destination or a per-post destination override.
3. **Engage** — DMs, comments, and Google reviews land in one unified inbox with AI-suggested replies; build automated WhatsApp/CTWA bot flows.
4. **Measure** — Celery syncs daily metrics into per-client analytics dashboards, with AI-narrated monthly reports.
5. **Self-host** — run it on your own infrastructure (Django + DRF + Celery + Postgres + React); you own the data and the keys.

## How it compares

An honest, structural comparison vs. closed-source SaaS tools (Hootsuite, Buffer,
Sprout Social). Social Stats is early-stage; this compares licensing/hosting and
the feature categories it actually ships — see [docs/COMPARISON.md](docs/COMPARISON.md)
for the full picture.

| | **Social Stats** | Closed SaaS |
|---|---|---|
| License | **Open source (MIT)** | Proprietary |
| Hosting | **Self-host, own your data** | Vendor cloud only |
| Source code | **Public & independently maintainable** | Closed |
| Cost | **Free to self-host** | Paid subscription |
| Platform coverage | FB, IG, YouTube, LinkedIn, Google Business, Telegram, Bale + WhatsApp | Varies by plan |
| Maturity / support | Early-stage, community | Mature, commercial SLAs |

## Self-hosting / installation

### Option A — Docker (recommended for self-hosting)

One command brings up the full stack — PostgreSQL, Redis, the Django/Channels
API, a Celery worker + beat, and the React app served by nginx on one origin:

```bash
# Pull the prebuilt multi-arch images (amd64 + arm64) and start:
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
# — or build from source instead: docker compose up -d --build

# optional: seed 3 demo accounts + 90 days of analytics
docker compose exec backend python manage.py demo_setup
# app:          http://localhost:3000
# Django admin: http://localhost:8000/admin/
```

Images are published by this repository to GHCR on releases/main builds:
`ghcr.io/jaavid/social-stats-backend` and
`ghcr.io/jaavid/social-stats-frontend` (`:latest` + semver tags).

The compose image names can be overridden with `SOCIAL_STATS_BACKEND_IMAGE` and
`SOCIAL_STATS_FRONTEND_IMAGE` when using a private registry or a different namespace.

Set at least `SECRET_KEY` (and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for AI) in a `.env.docker`
file at the repo root — see `backend/.env.example` for every variable.

### Option B — manual (local dev)

Python **3.12** and Node **20** are the CI reference versions. Redis is required for
non-eager Celery workers, and an Anthropic API key is only required for AI features.

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure env
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — at minimum set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY if you want AI features.

# Migrate the schema
python manage.py migrate

# (Optional, but recommended for first-time evaluation)
# Seed three demo accounts + 90 days of analytics data so the dashboards
# aren't empty. Prints the demo credentials on stdout.
python manage.py demo_setup

# Run
python manage.py runserver
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm start
# http://localhost:3000
```

### Celery (background sync + notifications)

In two extra terminals:

```bash
# worker
cd backend && source .venv/bin/activate
celery -A dashboard worker -l info

# beat (scheduled tasks)
cd backend && source .venv/bin/activate
celery -A dashboard beat -l info --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler
```

### Redis

```bash
# macOS
brew install redis && brew services start redis

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install redis-server && sudo systemctl start redis

# Docker
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis
```

## OAuth and bot-channel setup

To connect real social-platform accounts during local dev, OAuth platforms need
their own app credentials:

- **Meta (Facebook + Instagram)** — `https://developers.facebook.com` → Create
  App → Business type → Pages API + Instagram Graph API. Add redirect URI
  `http://localhost:8000/api/oauth/facebook/callback/`.
- **Google (YouTube + Google Business)** — `https://console.cloud.google.com` →
  enable YouTube Data API v3, YouTube Analytics API, Business Profile API. Add
  redirect URI `http://localhost:8000/api/oauth/google/callback/`.
- **LinkedIn** — `https://www.linkedin.com/developers` → request Marketing
  Developer Platform. Add redirect URI
  `http://localhost:8000/api/oauth/linkedin/callback/`.
- **Telegram / Bale** — create a bot with the provider, add the bot to the target
  channel/chat with permission to post, then use **Settings → Connected Accounts**
  to verify and store its bot token and `@channel` / numeric `chat_id`.

Drop the resulting `*_CLIENT_ID` / `*_CLIENT_SECRET` values into `backend/.env`.
Without OAuth credentials, those OAuth connect-account flows cannot complete;
everything else (composer drafts, bot-channel publishing after bot setup, AI
features, preview pages) remains independently configurable.
