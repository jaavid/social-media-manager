AI dashboard briefing.

Generates the "Today's briefing" string the home dashboard renders at the top.
4-5 short bullets summarising what the user should care about right now,
written in their brand voice via the `AIContextProvider`.

  >>> from social_stats.ai.dashboard_briefing import build_briefing
  >>> build_briefing(client)
  '• 3 new leads from Mumbai property campaign (high quality)\n'
  '• Engagement on Reel "Property Tour" up 240%\n'
  '• 2 negative reviews on GMB need response'

Three guardrails so this never blows up the dashboard:

  1. **Cached for 1 hour** keyed by `client_id` — refreshing the dashboard
     doesn't re-hit the AI. Counts/charts come from the live aggregator;
     the briefing is intentionally slower-moving prose.
  2. **Per-client rate-limited** at 10 generations/day. A user mashing
     "regenerate" in a debugging session can't blow through the AI budget.
  3. **Returns `''` on any failure** — bad model output, missing API key,
     no metrics for the client, AI safety reject. The dashboard renders
     without the briefing card; counts/activity etc are unaffected.

The briefing is a *summary*, not advice. It asks Claude to stick to facts
the AIContextProvider already surfaced (recent metrics, pending approvals,
new leads) — keeps the prompt short and the output reliably structured.
