"""
`unified_voice_prompt` rollout tests.

Covers the helper that the migrated callsites (ai_views, automation_engine,
ai/automation_ai) now use in place of the legacy `brand_voice_prompt`.
The helper is a thin shim around `AIContextProvider.as_prompt_fragment()`
with defensive fallback to the legacy helper on failure.

Verifies:
  • Returns '' on missing / falsy client (no client provided ⇒ no fragment).
  • Returns '' for a brand-new workspace with no metrics + no brand voice
    (matches the legacy helper's empty-output behaviour — drop-in safe).
  • Returns a non-empty fragment when the workspace has signal — and the
    fragment is a superset of what brand_voice_prompt would produce
    (i.e. always includes the workspace anchor on top of the voice text).
  • Falls back to brand_voice_prompt when AIContextProvider raises (the
    defensive try/except path).
  • Each Pattern-A migrated callsite imports the new helper.
