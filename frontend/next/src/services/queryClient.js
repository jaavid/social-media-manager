/**
 *
 * Defaults tuned for an SPA with frequent navigation:
 *   - staleTime 30s — most lists stay "fresh" for half a minute, killing
 *     the re-fetch storm when a user navigates away and back.
 *   - gcTime 5min — keep stale results around for 5 min so re-mounts are
 *     instant (data shows immediately, then revalidates in background).
 *   - retry once — we already wrap network failures in toast.error in
 *     individual fetchers; React Query retries on top would be noisy.
 *   - refetchOnWindowFocus on — when the user comes back to the tab, the
 *     critical lists revalidate. WebSocket events handle the inter-tab
 *     case for free.
 *
 * Keys follow a `[feature, ...params]` convention. The invalidation
 * helpers in `useRealtimeSync.js` rely on this — touch only the right
 * subtree on each event.
